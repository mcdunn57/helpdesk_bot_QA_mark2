This project is a helpdesk chatbot built with Python and powered by the Gemini API. It's designed to answer questions based on a predefined set of knowledge. Here's a breakdown of the key files and the overall logic:

Core Logic: Helpdesk_QA_Droid.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for the chatbot. It follows a common architecture in modern AI applications called Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Here's how it works, cell by cell:

Cell 2: Installation and Imports This cell sets up the environment by installing and importing all the necessary libraries. Key libraries include:

langchain and langgraph: To build the chatbot's logic and structure.
langchain_google_genai: To connect to Google's Gemini models.
pandas: To read and process the data from the CSV file.
faiss-cpu: For creating a searchable "vector store" of the knowledge base.
google-generativeai: The official Google library for its AI models.
Cell 3: API Key and Model Initialization This cell is all about connecting to the Google AI services:

It loads your GOOGLE_API_KEY from a .env file, which is a secure way to handle secret keys.
It initializes the language model (gemini-1.5-flash) which is used for generating responses, and an "embedding model" which is used to turn text into numerical representations for searching.
Cell 4: Data Loading and Vector Store Creation This is where the chatbot gets its knowledge:

It reads the Helpdesk_bot_QA.csv file using pandas.
It then creates a FAISS vector store. Think of this as a smart, searchable database. It takes the questions and answers from the CSV, uses the embedding model to turn them into numerical vectors, and stores them in a way that makes it very fast to find the most similar document to a user's query.
Cell 5: Defining the "State" This cell defines the data structure (AgentState) that gets passed around the different steps of the chatbot's process. It keeps track of the conversation history, the user's original question, a rephrased version of the question, and any document it retrieves from the knowledge base.

Cell 6: Defining the Chatbot's Actions (Nodes) This is where the main logic of the chatbot is defined as a series of "nodes" or steps:

intent_and_retrieve: This is the first step. When a user asks a question, this node:
Uses the language model to rephrase the user's question into a more standard or "canonical" form.
Searches the FAISS vector store for the most similar question in the knowledge base.
It checks how similar the match is (the "relevance score"). If the match is not very good, it ignores it.
generate_refined_response: This is the second step. It takes the information from the first step and:
If a relevant document was found, it uses the answer from that document to generate a helpful response for the user.
If no relevant document was found, it tells the user it couldn't find an answer.
It also provides a summary of what it did, which is useful for seeing how the chatbot is "thinking".
Cell 7: Building the "Graph" This cell connects the nodes together into a workflow using langgraph. It defines the sequence of operations: the process starts with intent_and_retrieve, and the output of that is passed to generate_refined_response.

Cell 8: Running the Chatbot This final cell brings everything together:

It starts an interactive loop where you can type in questions.
It takes your question, runs it through the graph, and prints the chatbot's response.
It also logs the entire conversation to a text file (e.g., user_output_log_20250826_164444.txt) for later review.
Knowledge Base: Helpdesk_bot_QA.csv
This is a simple CSV file that acts as the chatbot's brain. It contains two columns: "Question" and "Answer". The chatbot uses this file to find answers to your questions.

Other Files
README.md: A minimal file with a brief description of the project.
.gitignore: A standard file that tells Git which files to ignore (like the .env file with your secret API key).
user_output_log_...txt: These are the log files created by the chatbot, containing the history of conversations.
In essence, this project is a smart helpdesk assistant. Instead of just having a simple, keyword-based search, it uses a powerful language model to understand the meaning of your question and find the most relevant answer from its knowledge base.
